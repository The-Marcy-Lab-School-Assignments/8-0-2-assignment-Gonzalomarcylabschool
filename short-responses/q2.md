# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer
Environment variables are key-value pairs used to store configuration settings or sensitive information (ex: API keys, database credentials, etc...)outside of your code.
First you need to make sure that you have `dotenv` as a dependency, then create a `.env` file and add your environment variables. They can also be added through a hosting provider's interface.

```bash

API_KEY=yourapikey123
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/dbname

```

Finally in the `index.js`, access through the `process.env` object.

```js
const API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;
console.log(API_KEY);

```
