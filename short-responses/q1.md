# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
Our frontend can't safely make requests using the API key â€” anyone using our deployed application can just look at the Network tab to see the API keys in the request URL. This can lead to abuse of API quotas, unauthorized access, and/or data leaks. By sending the request from the server, API keys never reach the user's browser, protecting them from exposure.
